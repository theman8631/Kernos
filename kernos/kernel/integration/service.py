"""IntegrationService — production-shaped façade over IntegrationRunner.

PRESENCE-DECOUPLING-INTRODUCE C3. Wraps the V1 IntegrationRunner with
a stable production entry point so:

  - TurnRunner consumes a clean Protocol-conforming dependency
    (`async def run(inputs) -> Briefing`) without knowing about the
    runner's chain_caller / dispatcher / audit_emitter dependencies.
  - Construction is centralised — wiring sites build the service once
    with their concrete chain caller, read-only dispatcher, and audit
    emitter, then hand the service to the TurnRunner.
  - Future tuning lands here without disturbing the runner's V1
    contract.

The runner already implements:
  - First-pass clarification_needed production (the model emits it
    via __finalize_briefing__ when critical info is missing).
  - Explicit ActionEnvelope construction for action-shape
    decided_actions (added in PDI C1 to runner._finalize).
  - Safety-degraded routing (defer / constrained_response when
    required+safety_class cohorts failed).
  - Iterative loop with read-only tools; iteration cap from
    IntegrationConfig.

C3's substance:
  - IntegrationService factory + run() façade.
  - Updated system prompt teaching the model the new variants
    (clarification_needed, action_envelope) — see
    kernos/kernel/integration/template.py.
  - Tests for the first-pass clarification scenario and the envelope
    construction path.

C3 does NOT change the runner's internals. The runner's _finalize
already validates the envelope-required rule structurally; the
service simply provides the clean caller-facing surface.
