"""Durable per-instance event stream — SQLite-backed append-only timeline.

EVENT-STREAM-TO-SQLITE. A single queryable timeline of every meaningful
event across Kernos subsystems: relational dispatch, tool calls, gate
verdicts, compaction, plan step transitions, friction observations.

Design contract:

* :func:`emit` is fire-and-forget — callers append to an in-memory queue
  and return immediately. A background writer task flushes to SQLite
  every 2 seconds or when the queue reaches 100 events (whichever
  first). Ungraceful crash may lose up to 2 seconds of in-flight events.
* Shutdown drain: :func:`stop_writer` flushes the pending queue before
  returning, so a clean Kernos shutdown loses no events.
* Events are append-only. No updates, no deletes outside a future
  retention-eviction path (out of scope for this batch; 90-day default
  documented).
* Multi-tenancy: every query requires ``instance_id`` and returns only
  that instance's events.
* Name note: this module coexists with the older ``kernos.kernel.events``
  (``EventStream`` class, typed event taxonomy). The older layer stays
  untouched; this module is the new unified timeline V2's Cognition
  Kernel will consume.

Not part of this batch: consumers (reflection pass, situation model,
cross-member analytics), retention-eviction, cross-instance federation.

# Post-flush hook (WORKFLOW-LOOP-PRIMITIVE C1)
#
# Hooks fire after a successful SQLite batch write + commit, so they
# only see durably-persisted events. emit() is unchanged — its
# fire-and-forget contract is preserved; emit never awaits a hook.
#
# Execution scope: hooks run wherever _flush_once() runs successfully.
# That includes the writer task's periodic flush (the common path),
# the threshold-trigger background task spawned by emit(), the read
# APIs' pre-read flush, and explicit flush_now() / stop_writer drains.
# A slow hook therefore can slow callers that explicitly await a flush
# (reads, drain) — but it cannot affect emit's fast-path latency
# because emit either enqueues-and-returns or schedules the flush as
# a task.
#
# Failure isolation invariant: exceptions raised by any hook are
# caught + logged inside _fire_post_flush_hooks and MUST NOT propagate
# into event_stream's flush path or block other hooks. Durable event
# persistence stays independent of hook code health.
#
# The hook registry is module-level so multiple subsystems (trigger
# registry being the first; reflection-pass / improvement-loop in
# future specs) can attach without coordinating through the writer
# singleton's internal state.
