"""Per-operation safety resolution at dispatch time (PDI Kit edit).

Many tools have a single tool name with multiple operations selected
by argument values. `manage_covenants` is the canonical example: same
tool, different operations depending on `mode`. The runtime cannot
classify the call's safety from the tool descriptor alone — it needs
to look at the args.

This module implements the resolution rules from the PDI spec:

  1. If `explicit_operation` is provided, use it.
  2. Else if the descriptor has `operation_resolver`, call
     `resolver(args)` to derive the operation name.
  3. Else if the descriptor's `operations` map has exactly one entry,
     use that.
  4. Else the operation is ambiguous → conservative
     `OperationSafety.SENSITIVE_ACTION`. Tool is NEVER surfaced to
     integration's catalog when ambiguous.

The runtime also turns the resolved operation_name into an
`OperationSafety` via the descriptor's `safety_for(operation)` helper,
applying the SAFETY_FOR_GATE derivation when no explicit safety
override is set on the per-operation classification.

Resolver exception handling: if a tool's `operation_resolver` raises
(e.g., args missing a required key), the resolver is treated as
ambiguous-by-construction. The conservative fallback applies; a
warning is logged so the tool author can fix the resolver. Surfacing
the exception would make tool authoring brittle for the (common)
case where args may legitimately omit a discriminator field.

    `operation_name` is the resolved name when the descriptor knew
    enough to pick one (rules 1-3). It is None when the resolution
    was ambiguous (rule 4); callers must not surface an ambiguous
    operation to integration's catalog.

    `safety` is always populated. Ambiguous resolutions carry
    `DEFAULT_AMBIGUOUS_SAFETY` (sensitive_action) so the dispatch
    routing remains conservative even when the name is unknown.

    `ambiguous` is True only for rule 4. The audit trail uses this
    flag to record that the tool was rejected from integration's
    catalog due to ambiguity.

    `reason` is an operator-readable label describing which rule
    fired (`explicit`, `resolver`, `single_entry`, `ambiguous`).
