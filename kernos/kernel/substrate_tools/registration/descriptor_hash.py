"""Canonical SHA-256 hash over a workflow descriptor AST.

The hash is what an approval event commits to. Any field that varies
between proposal and registration without changing what the user
approved must be excluded; everything else is included.

Volatile fields (excluded — registry metadata only):

* ``id``, ``workflow_id``     — assigned at registration
* ``created_at``, ``updated_at``, ``registered_at`` — timestamps
* ``version``                 — sequence/lifecycle marker

Included fields (NOT excluded):

* ``display_name``, ``aliases``, ``intent_summary`` — what the user
  sees and approves
* ``trigger``, ``predicate``, ``verifier``, ``bounds``, all
  ``action_sequence`` entries — executable shape
* ``prev_version_id`` — Kit edit (v1→v2). For modifications, this
  field is set by the Compiler at proposal time and represents user
  intent ("modify THIS specific routine"). Including it in the hash
  means swapping it after approval invalidates the approval.
  Belt-and-suspenders with the modification-target-binding check
  in approval validation Step 5b.

Algorithm (deterministic):

1. Drop every key listed in :data:`DESCRIPTOR_VOLATILE_FIELDS` at the
   **top level only**. Nested ``id`` / ``version`` fields (e.g. inside
   an action's ``parameters``, a trigger, a verifier, or future
   provider payloads) are part of the executable descriptor and MUST
   contribute to the hash — otherwise two semantically distinct
   descriptors could collide.
2. Recursively sort all dict keys at every nesting level. Lists keep
   their order — list position is part of the executable shape.
3. Serialize to compact UTF-8 JSON with ``separators=(',', ':')``,
   no whitespace, no surrogateescape, ``sort_keys=False`` (we already
   sorted).
4. Compute SHA-256 of the bytes.
5. Return hex digest.

The output is a 64-character lowercase hex string.
