"""Cross-member disclosure gate (DISCLOSURE-GATE).

Read-time filter applied at context assembly during member M's active turn.
Enforces the simplified three-value relationship permission model
(full-access / no-access / by-permission) at the kernel layer so the agent
never sees another member's protected content during a turn that isn't
theirs.

Design principle: sensitivity is enforced by the kernel, not the agent.
The agent thinks; the kernel enforces. The agent cannot be trusted to
self-filter content already in its context — so we keep it out.

Filter order per entry (first match wins):
    1. Author check           — entry owned by M → PASS
    2. Open-sensitivity pass  — sensitivity=="open" → PASS
    3. Permission check       — M's declared permission toward the author:
                                 full-access  → PASS
                                 no-access    → FILTER (relationship_is_no_access)
                                 by-permission/missing → FILTER (no_relationship_permission)

Fail-closed: on any error building the permission map or evaluating a rule,
the gate filters the entry. Preserving the disclosure invariant is worth
the occasional false-filter; the owner can fix over-restriction by
declaring relationships correctly.

Covenant topic-exception (step 4 of the spec) is NOT implemented here —
existing covenants don't support `relationship:A:B` scope or a `withhold`
action. Adding those is a primitive extension escalated separately.

The gate logs each filter event to the runtime trace with a reason code
and no filtered content. Reason codes:
    no_relationship_permission  — no declaration OR implicit by-permission
    relationship_is_no_access   — M's side is explicitly no-access
    gate_error                  — failure path, fail-closed
