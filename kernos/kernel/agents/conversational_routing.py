"""Thin conversational-routing consumer of AgentRegistry.resolve_natural.

DOMAIN-AGENT-REGISTRY C4. The message handler / cohort layer
decides whether a user message contains a routing intent (e.g. "ask
the spec agent to draft this", "send to my code reviewer"); the
registry only resolves once asked. This module is the small
adapter between "we have a phrase + scope" and "here's a routing
decision."

Per Kit edit v1 → v2: the registry does NOT own intent detection.
This module mirrors that boundary — it doesn't decide WHEN to
route, only what to do once the handler has decided to ask.

Three decision shapes the handler can act on:

  - DispatchTo(record): handler routes the relevant content to
    this agent's inbox via the same RouteToAgentAction path
    workflows use.
  - AskClarification(candidates): handler responds with a
    clarification question naming each candidate by display_name
    and domain_summary.
  - Unknown(known_agents): handler responds with "I don't
    recognize that agent — here are the agents I know about" with
    the active records to choose from.
