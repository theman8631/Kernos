"""Bridge between the workshop tool descriptor and the dispatch gate.

The dispatch gate consumes string effect tokens
("read", "soft_write", "hard_write", "unknown"). The workshop
descriptor's GateClassification enum is richer (it adds delete) and
supports per-operation overrides. This module is the small adapter
that turns a (descriptor, operation) pair into the existing gate's
effect token.

Mapping (Kit's response on question 1):

    READ        → "read"
    SOFT_WRITE  → "soft_write"
    HARD_WRITE  → "hard_write"
    DELETE      → "hard_write"   (no destructive_irreversible in v1;
                                  delete maps to hard_write so the
                                  gate fires confirmation; runtime
                                  enforcement adds the safety net)

A future spec may introduce destructive_irreversible as a separate
gate effect; the mapping changes here when that lands.
