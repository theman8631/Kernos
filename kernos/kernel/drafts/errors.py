"""Typed error hierarchy for the workflow draft primitive.

Per SPEC-WDP: 1 base + 8 typed subclasses. Distinct error types
let callers handle different failure modes without parsing
strings. ``DraftAliasCollision`` is intentionally distinct from
``DraftEnvelopeInvalid`` (Kit edit, v1 → v2) because the failure
mode and remediation differ.
