"""Tier classification + budgets — explicit pure-function routing (PDI C5).

Per architect's C5 guidance: tier conditions are distinct, not a
fuzzy ladder. The most common implementation error is conflating
them — retry on a non-transient failure, or modify when retry would
fix it. The routing logic lives here as a pure function so it is
explicitly testable and never delegated to model judgment.

Tier conditions (locked in C5):

  Tier 1 (Retry):
    - Failure plausibly transient (connection error, rate-limit,
      5xx-ish provider state).
    - Step is idempotent (action-tool authors mark this; default
      assume idempotent for retry budget pursuit; non-idempotent
      tools opt out by exhausting the retry budget at 0).
    - Per-step retry budget remains (default 3, configurable per
      tool descriptor).
    - Effect: runtime re-dispatches with same args.

  Tier 2 (Modify):
    - Failure surfaced a CORRECTIVE signal (the tool returned guidance
      to retry differently — e.g. "rate-limit, batch size too large"
      or a stub-reload schema-mismatch synthetic result).
    - Step's intent unchanged; mechanism changes.
    - Per-step modify budget remains (default 2).
    - Envelope-validated (Kit edit — "same intent" is model assertion,
      not runtime guarantee).
    - Effect: model emits modified Step; runtime dispatches the new
      step.

  Tier 3 (Pivot):
    - Step SUCCEEDED but the result re-shapes the plan
      (information-driven divergence).
    - Original step's intent unachievable but a different intermediate
      goal would still serve the decided_action; rest of plan still
      makes sense.
    - Per-step pivot budget remains (default 2).
    - Envelope-validated.
    - Effect: model produces a different intermediate goal; runtime
      dispatches.

  Tier 4 (Reassemble): plan invalidated, decided_action still valid.
    Lands in C6.

  Tier 5 (Surface):
    - B1 (action invalidated): budgets exhausted, envelope violation,
      covenant block, etc. → terminate with reintegration context.
    - B2 (user disambiguation needed): mid-action ambiguity; structured
      ClarificationNeeded constructed; reintegration stored for next
      turn (NO same-turn integration re-entry per Kit edit).
    Lands in C6.

The classify_routing pure function is the single source of truth for
which tier fires given the inputs. Tier handlers consume its output;
they never re-classify.
