"""Envelope validation — the structural enforcer of "EnactmentService
never changes decided_action" (PDI C5).

Per Kit edit on PDI: ActionEnvelope is structural, not prose-derived.
Validation runs at every plan-changing tier:

  - Initial plan creation (this commit, C5).
  - Tier-2 modify (C5; per Kit edit, not just pivot/reassemble).
  - Tier-3 pivot (C5).
  - Tier-4 reassemble (C6).

Validation checks each Step against the Briefing's ActionEnvelope:

  1. Step's `tool_class` ∈ envelope.allowed_tool_classes.
  2. Step's `operation_name` ∈ envelope.allowed_operations.
  3. Step does not match any pattern in envelope.forbidden_moves.
  4. Step does not bypass envelope.confirmation_requirements
     (a step whose operation_name is in confirmation_requirements
     must be the LAST step of its sub-chain in this turn — the
     downstream step that actually performs the require-confirmation
     operation cannot fire without explicit user confirmation, which
     crosses a turn boundary).

Returns a ValidationOutcome carrying `valid: bool` plus a redacted
`reason` for audit. Pure function — no I/O, no model calls — so the
tier handlers can call it cheaply at every plan-changing decision.

Universal across tools because the envelope itself is constructed by
integration per-action from briefing reasoning. The validation logic
is generic.

    Pure function. Walks each step through validate_step_against_envelope
    first; on first failure returns immediately. Then enforces:

      Confirmation-boundary rule: any step whose operation_name is in
      envelope.confirmation_requirements is allowed only when the user
      has explicitly confirmed in this turn. Since enactment cannot
      cross a turn boundary mid-plan, a require-confirmation step in
      the plan is a structural violation UNLESS it is the explicit
      authorisation envelope (i.e. integration on this turn already
      saw the user's confirmation alongside the request, and produced
      an envelope that lists the operation in allowed_operations
      without listing it in confirmation_requirements). Concretely:
      if a step's operation_name is in envelope.confirmation_requirements,
      validation rejects the plan with REASON_CONFIRMATION_BYPASS.

      Rationale: confirmation_requirements means "this operation needs
      explicit user confirmation," and the canonical Kernos pattern
      is to cross a turn boundary for that confirmation. A plan
      attempting to chain through a confirmation step in the same
      turn is a structural violation; the previous turn's draft must
      surface to the user, and the next turn's integration produces
      a fresh envelope with the send permitted (confirmation_requirements
      empty for the send step).
