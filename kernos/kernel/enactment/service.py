"""EnactmentService — branch decision + thin-path rendering (PDI C4).

Consumes a Briefing and routes structurally:

  - decided_action.kind == execute_tool → full machinery (C5-C6)
  - everything else → thin path (render-only)

Render-only kinds (per Kit edit, propose_tool joins the conversational
set because the dispatch happens on the next turn after user confirms,
not in this turn):

  - respond_only
  - defer
  - constrained_response
  - pivot
  - clarification_needed
  - propose_tool

The thin path NEVER dispatches tools. This invariant is enforced
structurally: the thin-path code path takes only the presence renderer
as its dependency. There is no dispatcher reachable from this branch.

Audit category: enactment.terminated. Subtypes:
  - success_thin_path: any non-clarification thin-path render.
  - thin_path_proposal_rendered: propose_tool rendered (proposal is
    awaiting user confirmation; the dispatch happens on the next
    turn's execute_tool decision, NOT here).
  - b1_action_invalidated: full machinery termination (C5-C6).
  - b2_user_disambiguation_needed: full machinery surfaced a B2
    clarification or thin-path rendered a populated-partial_state
    clarification (the latter case — thin-path B2 echo — happens
    when integration emits clarification_needed with a populated
    partial_state because a previous turn's enactment surfaced it).

C4 only emits success_thin_path, thin_path_proposal_rendered, and
b2_user_disambiguation_needed. C5-C6 add b1_action_invalidated and
the per-step / per-tier audit events.
