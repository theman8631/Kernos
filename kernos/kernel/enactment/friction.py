"""Friction observer — write-only sink for tier-1/2 exhaustion (PDI C6).

Per spec Section 5g (and architect's C6 guidance):
  - The friction observer accumulates tickets describing tier-1 retry
    or tier-2 modify exhaustion on a specific (tool, operation) pair
    within a single turn.
  - **Write-only.** Tickets do NOT affect dispatch; do NOT
    short-circuit retry/modify; do NOT inform routing in v1.
    Operators read tickets to identify problematic tools and
    divergence patterns.
  - Architectural shape: observer with no feedback loop. v1 contract.

The Protocol's record() method returns None — there is no return-
value channel through which a ticket could affect subsequent
behaviour. Implementations write to a store / log / external sink;
the EnactmentService never reads back.

Composes with the existing Phase 6A friction observer primitive in
the broader Kernos codebase. The Protocol here is the enactment-side
contract; concrete adapters bridge to that primitive.
