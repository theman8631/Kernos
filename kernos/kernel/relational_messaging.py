"""Relational Messaging primitive (RELATIONAL-MESSAGING v5).

Envelope model and lifecycle constants. One member's agent can initiate a
purposeful exchange (request_action / ask_question / inform) with another
member's agent. The receiving agent's turn naturally applies the disclosure
gate to what it can see — we don't need to gate the conversation itself.

The dispatcher (see kernos/kernel/relational_dispatch.py) orchestrates
permission checks, atomic state transitions, and two delivery paths:
  - Immediate push for time_sensitive urgency (via the adapter layer)
  - Next-turn surfacing for elevated and normal urgency (queued, picked
    up during the recipient's assemble phase)

Kit's sole implementation hazard in v5 review was atomic state transitions.
The StateStore's new transition_relational_message_state() is implemented
as genuine CAS (SQLite: UPDATE ... WHERE state=? + rowcount check; JSON:
read-check-write under filelock). Never read-check-write at the call site.
