"""Per-turn coordinator for the decoupled reasoning pipeline.

Introduced by PRESENCE-DECOUPLING-INTRODUCE C2. The TurnRunner is the
orchestration shell sitting above the four cognition layers:

    cohort fan-out → IntegrationService → EnactmentService → response

It owns nothing except the orchestration. Domain logic lives in the
services it composes:

  - cohort fan-out: existing CohortFanOutRunner produces a
    CohortFanOutResult with required_safety_cohort_failures metadata.
  - IntegrationService (lands in C3): consumes the fan-out result
    plus conversation thread plus surfaced read-only tool catalog
    and produces a Briefing.
  - EnactmentService (lands in C4-C6): consumes the Briefing and
    routes between thin path (render-only) and full machinery
    (plan + tier hierarchy + envelope validation).
  - Response delivery: translates the enactment outcome back into a
    ReasoningResult so the existing message-handler call sites are
    unchanged.

C2 scope: skeleton + feature-flag routing. The services are typed via
Protocols so they can be stubbed for tests; concrete classes wire in
later commits.

Feature flag (per spec Section 7): KERNOS_USE_DECOUPLED_TURN_RUNNER
read at process start. Default OFF. ReasoningService.reason() routes
to TurnRunner.run_turn() only when the flag is set AND a TurnRunner
instance has been wired. With the flag off, the existing reasoning
loop runs unchanged.

Acceptance criterion 7 (Kit edit) — load-bearing seam:
required_safety_cohort_failures must flow TurnRunner →
IntegrationService at the boundary, not just be representable on the
runner. The TurnRunner uses build_integration_inputs_from_fan_out so
the plumbing is consistent across call sites.
