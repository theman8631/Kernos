"""Audit-log integration for workshop tool invocations.

Per the Kit-revised spec:

- Service-bound and internal tool invocations both flow into the
  existing audit log (no new log surface). The shape adds two
  category fields:
  - audit_category: operator-readable, free-form, defaults to the
    tool name for standalone tools and to the service's
    audit_category for service-bound tools. Surfaced in operator
    filters so a human can grep by service or tool family.
  - normalized_category: a fixed-vocabulary token that downstream
    processors key off without parsing operator-readable strings.
    Two values: tool.invocation.internal and
    tool.invocation.external_service.

- Payload digest: SHA-256 of canonicalised JSON. Canonicalisation
  follows RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalisation Scheme, JCS) closely
  enough for our purposes: keys sorted lexicographically, no
  insignificant whitespace, UTF-8. The full RFC 8785 spec includes
  ECMAScript-style number formatting for edge cases (very large
  numbers, NaN, Infinity); audit payloads do not contain those, so
  Python's default number serialisation matches the canonical form
  in practice. The digest is sufficient for after-the-fact integrity
  checks without retaining sensitive request bodies.

The raw payload is not stored. Only the digest. Tokens, refresh
tokens, and credential values inside payloads cannot leak through
the audit log.

    filtering and replay continue to work.

    Fields:
        type: always "tool_call" so the existing log writer does not
            need a new path.
        timestamp: ISO-8601 string (UTC) recorded by the writer.

        member_id: invoking member identifier.
        space_id: active space at invocation time.
        tool_name: descriptor name.
        operation: which named operation was invoked, if the tool
            declared per-operation classifications. Empty when the
            tool dispatches a single kind of work.
        service_id: empty for internal tools; the bound service id
            for external-service tools.
        authority: the authority subset the invocation actually used
            (i.e., the operations the tool's authority list grants).
        audit_category: operator-readable category (free-form).
        normalized_category: fixed vocabulary; one of the
            NORMALIZED_* constants above.
        payload_digest: hex SHA-256 of the canonical JSON of the
            tool's input payload. Raw payload is never stored.
        success: True when the tool returned without raising.
        error: sanitised error message when success is False; empty
            otherwise. Service errors that include token-shaped values
            are scrubbed by the caller before this is constructed.
