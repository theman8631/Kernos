"""Bridge / AgentInbox interface.

The ``route_to_agent`` action library verb writes payloads to an
AgentInbox provider. Multiple concrete implementations are possible
(Notion, local folder, S3, etc.); the workflow primitive itself only
depends on the abstract Protocol. v1 ships ``NotionAgentInbox`` as
the available concrete during the developing-Kernos period;
installations choose whether to bind it.

Provider-configuration-containment (Kit edit, narrow review):
``route_to_agent`` depends on a configured ``AgentInbox`` provider
rather than a hardcoded default. The action library's
``RouteToAgentAction`` raises ``AgentInboxUnavailable`` with a clear
message if no provider is bound. Pin: structural test verifies the
explicit unavailable-error path rather than silent fall-through to
Notion.

Provider-independence pin: only the concrete inbox class at the
bottom of this file may carry vendor-specific imports / URLs / tool
namespaces. The Protocol itself MUST stay provider-neutral.
Structural test scans the workflows + webhooks source tree for
vendor-integration patterns and only allows them inside the
concrete-inbox class body.

# Approval-request payload block (WLP-GATE-SCOPING C2)
#
# When a workflow's gate_ref action is a ``route_to_agent`` posting an
# approval-shape message, the action's payload includes a documented
# ``approval_request`` block. Receiving agents (founder UI, architect
# agent, future agents) read this block to know what response to
# compose; the response event MUST carry ``execution_id`` and
# ``gate_nonce`` in its payload so the engine's match logic resumes
# the right paused execution.
#
# This is **documented schema, not enforced wire format**. The
# engine's `_on_post_flush_for_gates` match logic enforces the
# ``execution_id`` + ``gate_nonce`` binding; the AgentInbox just
# carries the request data verbatim. Any concrete inbox provider
# is free in how it serialises the block, as long as receivers
# can read it back.
#
# A descriptor authoring an approval gate via route_to_agent uses
# template interpolation (`{workflow.execution_id}`,
# `{workflow.gate_nonce}`) so the engine fills in the runtime values
# before dispatching the verb.
