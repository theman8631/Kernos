"""Runtime enforcement for workshop tool invocations (Kit edit 2).

Layered on top of the registration-time authoring-pattern validator
(C3). The four checks defined here run at invocation time, before
the tool's implementation receives control:

1. Hash check: descriptor JSON + implementation source unchanged
   since registration. Catches post-registration edits to either
   file. The registration hash is recorded at register_tool time
   alongside the catalog entry.

2. Operation authority re-check: the invoked operation must be in
   the tool's declared authority list. Service-bound tools also
   re-validate against the service's declared operations, so a
   service descriptor edit that removes an operation invalidates
   any tool that still depends on it.

3. Credential scope re-check: service-bound tools must have a
   non-expired credential for the invoking member. The credential
   accessor is re-bound to the runtime context at every invocation;
   this is a pre-flight check that surfaces "credential missing or
   expired" cleanly rather than letting the tool's HTTP call fail
   later.

4. Data dir sandbox enforcement: provided as a verification helper
   the dispatcher and post-invocation review can call. Full
   sandbox enforcement at runtime requires subprocess isolation
   (a future spec); the in-process check is "best effort where
   feasible" per the spec language. Force-registered tools are
   subject to the same enforcement as ordinary tools — force
   bypasses authoring-pattern validation only, never runtime
   isolation (Kit edit 5).

All checks raise `RuntimeEnforcementError` (or a subclass) on
failure. The dispatcher catches and renders a clean error to the
agent / member rather than letting the tool run.
