"""SELF-MAINTENANCE-REVIEW-V1 — KERNOS's daily self-stewardship review.

Once a day, KERNOS holds ONE slice of its own code + systems up to the light
through two lenses:

  * **Corrective** — is this still the healthiest implementation of its
    intention, or has it drifted / decayed / grown an unguarded edge?
  * **Generative** — even when healthy, is there a more efficient or effective
    way, and does this function's validity + role still hold up against the
    overarching intention of the WHOLE KERNOS system?

It produces a short, honest report and surfaces it as a whisper to the main
agent **to consider** — never to act on autonomously. Every actual change still
flows through approval-gated ``improve_kernos``. Thoughtful evolution, not
out-of-hand mutation: at most ONE minor, reversible, well-justified evolution
idea per review.

Design mirrors recursive_self_heal: seam-injected (consult_fn / whisper_fn),
deterministic + unit-testable. This lane's default and enablement semantics are
recorded in ``docs/reference/runtime-defaults.md`` — the single authoritative
table — rather than restated here, where they would drift. The orchestration (``maybe_run_daily``) is
idle-aware and runs at most once per 24h.
