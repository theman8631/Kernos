## Key Architectural Decisions (permanent reference)

These are load-bearing decisions that Claude Code should always respect:

1. **Handler never knows about platform adapters; adapters never know about the handler.** All communication through NormalizedMessage.
2. **Every piece of state keyed to instance_id.** Multi-instance from day one.
3. **No destructive deletions.** Shadow archive for user data. Internal operational artifacts (whispers, expired tokens) can be cleaned up.
4. **Gate philosophy: reactive soft_write = agent acts.** The user's conversational intent IS the authorization — whether explicit ("set an appointment"), confirmation ("Sure"), or rule-based. Gate only evaluates: hard_write (always), third-party impact, proactive/background actions, must_not covenant violations. "Conservative by default" applies to what the AGENT initiates, not what the USER requests.
5. **Behavioral contracts are the safety mechanism, not access restriction.** "Agent thinks, kernel enforces."
6. **Cognitive UI grammar:** RULES / NOW / STATE / RESULTS / ACTIONS / MEMORY / CONVERSATION — rebuilt every turn.
7. **Cohort agent architecture:** One principal reasoning agent surrounded by bounded specialized mediators (Router, Shaper, Surfacer, Gate, Harvester, Budgeter, Friction Observer, Preference Parser, etc.). Each should be bypassable.
8. **Turn serialization invariant:** For any (instance, space) pair, only one turn may own reasoning and side effects at a time. Per-space mailbox/runner pattern.
9. **Depth should be recoverable, not always loaded.** Memory, facts, and tools are selectively loaded per-turn.
10. **Provider neutral.** Use "lightweight model" or "cheap model" instead of "Haiku." The cheap model varies by provider configuration.
11. **Subtraction over addition.** When addressing problems, prefer: removal > structural enforcement > simplification > adding instructions. More prompt text has diminishing returns. Enforce in code, not English.
12. **Spec handoff principle.** Spec everything you're CERTAIN about (even if it's "how"). Leave open only things where Claude Code's codebase knowledge produces a better answer. Each spec opens with explicit Certain vs Open declaration.
13. **Fallback chain for LLM providers.** Three named chains (primary, simple, cheap), each an ordered list of `ChainEntry(provider, model)`. Data-driven via `ChainConfig` dict — built from env vars today, pointed at `config/providers.json` tomorrow. `_call_chain()` is the single fallback entry point. Currently: Codex → GLM-5.1 → MiniMax M2.7 → Gemma 4 31B.
14. **Plans never rot.** Three-tier resilience: provider retries → step retries with backoff → hourly slow-poll. Plan sweep every 10 minutes catches stale plans. Recovery on restart re-enqueues in-progress steps. Only explicit user action pauses a plan.
15. **Personality via principles, not traits.** "Your personality is the shape of your attention." Decision principles produce behavior; trait lists produce cosplay. Operating principles split into core non-negotiables (always enforced) and situational guidance (prefer/generally).
16. **Covenant selective injection.** Covenants classified as pinned (safety, system) or situational (preferences). MessageAnalyzer selects relevant situational covenants per turn. Prevents prompt bloat as covenants accumulate.
17. **User intent IS authorization.** When the user explicitly requests an action (amount, recipient, target specified), don't re-confirm. Their request is the confirmation. Gate only intervenes for ambiguous + high-stakes.
18. **Information belongs to whoever shared it.** Routine information flows naturally between known contacts. Sensitive/confidential information requires the sharer's consent before disclosure — even to people they know well.
19. **Spirit covenant renders first.** The agent reads purpose and warmth before rules and constraints. "You got this" before "never do X."
20. **browser-use REJECTED.** Nested agent frameworks that wrap the LLM in another agent layer are an anti-pattern for Kernos. Native MCP tools (Lightpanda) are the right abstraction.
21. **DuckDuckGo as search fallback.** Brave primary → DDG safety net on rate limit. Self-hosted SearXNG parked as future option if Brave remains problematic.
22. **Follow-ups: dual-path.** Explicit via manage_schedule (real-time), implicit via compaction extraction (safety net). Compaction follow-ups are provisional — deduped against existing triggers before creation.
23. **Whisper delivery: ambient by default.** Direct message only for EXTERNAL_DEADLINE type with due date within 24 hours. Everything else surfaces as a whisper the agent weaves into conversation.
24. **90-day horizon cap.** Compaction-extracted follow-ups beyond 90 days are rejected. Long-horizon items belong in Living State or Ledger, not triggers.
25. **SQLite per instance, instance.db shared.** Each instance gets `data/{instance}/kernos.db` with WAL mode. Shared cross-instance state (members, channels, relay) lives in `data/instance.db`. Schema designed for access patterns, not JSON mirroring — indexed columns for queries, JSON overflow for rare fields.
26. **Bjork dual-strength memory.** Knowledge entries ranked by `compute_retrieval_strength()` before MessageAnalyzer sees them. Well-established facts (high storage_strength) resist decay. Entries below 0.10 strength filtered entirely. Replaces the crude `_is_stale_knowledge(days=14)` check.
27. **instance_id replaces tenant_id.** Kernos instances aren't tenants — they're Kernos instances. The naming reflects the product, not infrastructure jargon.
28. **Invite code system: one mechanism, three use cases.** KERN-XXXX codes handle new user registration, existing user connecting a new platform, and spam rejection. One table, one code path. Zero LLM calls for all unregistered sender paths.
29. **Invite codes are platform-locked.** A code generated for Discord only redeems on Discord. Instructions travel with the code. If the platform isn't set up, the agent gets setup instructions instead of a code. The instructions registry is extensible for future adapters.
30. **Adapters are dumb pipe.** Discord, SMS, Telegram adapters know their platform and nothing else. Member identity, authorization, and security are handler concerns. Adding a new platform is ~150 lines of adapter + poller. See `docs/ADAPTER-GUIDE.md`.
31. **Per-member soul.** "Kernos" is the platform name, not the agent identity. Each member hatches their own agent with its own name, personality, and relationship. Soul dataclass fields are deprecated — identity lives in member_profiles.
32. **Hatching is organic emergence, not configuration.** 15-turn minimum. 8 engagement points (entry energy, resonance testing, naming, emoji, genuine curiosity, correction surfacing, rhetorical discovery, uncertainty honesty). Graduation produces a personality hypothesis, not a verdict.
33. **Stewardship emerges from compaction.** Value extraction and tension detection ride the compaction harvest — zero additional LLM calls. Operational insights only surface when there's a concrete actionable idea, not pattern reports.
34. **Sensitivity classification at write time.** Every knowledge entry tagged open/contextual/personal at harvest. Conservative default (personal when unsure). Enforcement via member_id filtering + future cross-member decision procedure.
35. **Relationships are declared, not inferred.** Pairwise, bidirectional, with four permission profiles (full-share, work-only, coordination-only, minimal). Conservative provisional defaults until both sides confirm. Topic exceptions are covenants with relationship scope.
36. **The 24 Escalation.** Each failed sender attempt escalates: 24 seconds → 24 minutes → 24 hours → 24 days → 24 years → 24 centuries. Spamming while blocked accelerates through tiers.
37. **Tool receipts paint reality.** After each turn with tool calls, a receipt entry logs effects in the world ("Created event: Team standup, 9am") not API calls. The agent sees its own prior actions on future turns.
38. **Full transparency.** The agent has no hidden instructions. The owner may inspect any part of the operating context. "Absence of evidence in your window is not evidence of absence in reality."
