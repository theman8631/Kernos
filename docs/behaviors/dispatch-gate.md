# Dispatch Gate

The dispatch gate guards every write/action tool call before execution. Read operations pass silently. Writes go through three-step authorization.

## How It Works

When the agent calls a tool classified as `soft_write` or `hard_write`, the gate fires:

### Step 1: Token Check
Programmatic approval tokens for API callers. If a valid, unused token matches the tool call, it passes immediately. This is the mechanism for confirmed pending actions.

### Step 2: Permission Override
Fast dictionary lookup on the tenant profile's `permission_overrides`. If the capability has an `"always-allow"` override, the gate is bypassed entirely. Permission overrides are mechanical — they are NOT in the covenant rules text shown to the model.

### Step 3: Model Evaluation
One cheap Haiku call sees:
- Recent user messages (last few turns)
- The agent's reasoning that led to the tool call
- The proposed tool call with arguments
- Active covenant rules

The model returns one of four verdicts:

- **EXPLICIT** — the user clearly asked for this action
- **AUTHORIZED** — a standing rule or clear context covers it
- **CONFLICT** — the user asked for it, but a `must_not` covenant applies. The agent tells the user about the conflict.
- **DENIED** — no authorization found

## What Happens When Blocked

When the gate returns DENIED or CONFLICT:

1. The action becomes a `PendingAction` stored on the reasoning service
2. The agent's response includes a `[CONFIRM:N]` tag (e.g., `[CONFIRM:1]`)
3. If the user replies confirming, the handler replays the tool call with an approval token
4. Pending actions expire after 1 hour

## Effect Classification

| Effect | Gate behavior | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| read | Bypass (no gate) | remember, list_files, read_file, read_soul, read_source, read_doc |
| soft_write | Gate evaluates | write_file, delete_file, update_soul, manage_covenants, evaluate (browser JS) |
| hard_write | Gate evaluates | create-event, send-email, delete-event |

Unknown tools default to `hard_write` (safe default).

## Hallucination Detection & Retry

When the agent claims to have used a tool but no tool was actually called (iterations=0 + tool-claiming language in response), the system detects this and retries:

1. A corrective system message is injected telling the agent not to claim actions without calling tools
2. The LLM is called again with the correction
3. If the retry succeeds (honest response or actual tool call), the corrected response is used
4. If both attempts fabricate, the user sees: "I tried to do that but wasn't able to execute the action. Can you try asking again?"
