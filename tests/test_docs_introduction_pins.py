"""Pins for the DOCS-INTRODUCTION-INTEGRATION-ARC surface (DOCS-INTRO C2).

Two structural pins + one self-description template pin:

  1. Notion-leakage pin (Kit edit 3): scans the SHIPPED surface
     (canonical doc + README link + reach mechanism code path) for
     notion.so / notion.com / Notion-URL references. Fails loudly
     on leak. Structural enforcement, not review-time inspection.

  2. Self-description template pin: confirms the operating-principles
     template routes "what are you?" reads via read_doc to
     `kernos-introduction.md` (the new canonical), NOT to the
     deprecated `identity/about-kernos.md` target.

  3. read_doc reach pin: confirms that calling
     read_doc("kernos-introduction.md") returns the canonical doc
     content (not an error or a fallback). Verifies the reach
     mechanism is actually wired to the right target.

The Notion-leakage pin is the load-bearing one — Kernos's
documentation surface ships from the local repo and must continue
working without any Notion dependency.
