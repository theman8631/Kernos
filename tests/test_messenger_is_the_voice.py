"""Tests for MESSENGER-IS-THE-VOICE.

The DispatchGate excludes ``send_relational_message`` by tool-call name so
the Messenger (Layer 3) becomes the unconditional voice of cross-member
welfare judgment. Regression coverage:

1. All three RM intents pass through the gate without pause or
   confirmation request.
2. Non-RM sensitive actions still route through the gate's model check
   (exclusion is scoped to the tool-call name, not broader).
3. The exclusion reason/method fields match the
   ``messenger_delegated`` / ``messenger_handoff`` contract so auditors
   can find it in the trace.

Zero-LLM-call: the reasoning service is stubbed. The exclusion short-
circuits before any cheap-chain call fires, so the test doesn't need a
real LLM even for scenarios that would normally invoke
``_evaluate_model``.

    production instantiation site
    ``MessageHandler._get_relational_dispatcher``. If a future refactor
