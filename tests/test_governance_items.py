"""SELF-REVIEW-SURFACING-INTEGRITY-V1 — durable human-gated governance items.

The invariant under test: a human-gated finding must not be routed to a
one-shot ephemeral whisper, because that is indistinguishable from a finding
that was never raised. These assert the durable queue behind the human gate —
open, upsert, enumerate, close-on-condition, shadow-archive, reopen — plus the
fail-closed classification boundary.
