## Detailed Results

### Step 0: Retrieval service initialization

**Expected:** RetrievalService wired to handler

**Actual:** has_retrieval=True

**Status:** PASS

### Step 1: Entity query: Henderson

**Expected:** Response mentions Henderson with linked knowledge

**Actual:** I've got **Sarah Henderson** in memory — a colleague of yours, possibly with a legal/collaborator role. I have a phone number on file for her (142-555-9234).

That's the extent of what I know. Is there something specific you're trying to figure out about her, or were you thinking of someone else?

**Status:** PASS

### Step 2: Relationship query: wife

**Expected:** Response mentions Liana or wife with knowledge

**Actual:** I don't have anything on file about your wife. You haven't shared details about her with me yet — what's on your mind?

**Status:** SOFT PASS

**Note:** The agent said "I don't have anything on file about your wife" — the Liana entity exists with alias "user's wife" but the substring query "my wife" didn't match. Acceptance criterion #2 (SAME_AS entity merge returning Liana) is unmet in live testing. Deferred: semantic entity matching for relational queries. The test passed the keyword check but did not pass the intent of the acceptance criterion.

### Step 3: Historical query: D&D campaign

**Expected:** Response mentions D&D campaign content

**Actual:** The full campaign history is actually right here in my context — no need to dig further. Here's the rundown:

**The Setup**
Pip (your level 3 rogue) is investigating the **Ashen Veil** in the city of Tidemark. It started at the docks — a suspicious grey-cloaked figure, a locked warehouse, a cluster of unmarked crates bearing a burned circle-and-line symbol, a tripwire, and muffled voices behind a far door. Pip retreated without tripping anything and linked up with **Mara** at the Rusty Anchor ta

**Status:** PASS

### Step 3b: Archive latency check

**Expected:** Response within 15 seconds

**Actual:** 38.6s

**Status:** FAIL

### Step 4: Foresight query

**Expected:** Response addresses the query (may not have foresight data)

**Actual:** Based on what's in my current context, here's what I have tracked for you:

- **Dentist appointment** — needs to be scheduled for next Tuesday (Mar 18) at 2pm
- **Groceries** — milk, eggs, bread, olive oil
- **Liana's birthday gift** — March 25th; she's into pottery and Italian cooking, still deciding on what to get
- **Weekend hiking** — need to check the forecast and loop in Greg

That's everything I've got. Anything to add or update?

**Status:** PASS

### Step 5a: Behavioral instruction: agent acknowledgment

**Expected:** Agent acknowledges the instruction

**Actual:** Got it — I'll always check with you before reaching out to Sarah Henderson. Added to how I handle her.

**Status:** PASS

### Step 5b: Behavioral instruction: rule creation

**Expected:** CovenantRule created with source='user_stated' mentioning Henderson

**Actual:** user_stated rules: 2, henderson match: True

**Status:** PASS

### Step 6a: Global instruction: agent acknowledgment

**Expected:** Agent acknowledges

**Actual:** Noted — I won't bring it up.

**Status:** PASS

### Step 6b: Global instruction: rule creation

**Expected:** CovenantRule created mentioning divorce, context_space=None

**Actual:** user_stated rules: 4, divorce match: True

**Status:** PASS

### Step 7: Rule awareness

**Expected:** Agent references behavioral rules in response

**Actual:** Here are the key rules I operate by:

**Hard limits:**
- Never contact anyone (including Henderson) without your approval first
- Never send communications on your behalf without confirming with you
- Never delete or archive your data without your awareness
- Never share your private info with unrecognized senders
- Always confirm before anything that costs money
- Won't bring up your divorce

**General approach:**
- Act when the situation is clearly right; only pause when stakes genuinely warra

**Status:** PASS

### Step 8: Unrelated query: no false memories

**Expected:** Agent responds without claiming stored knowledge about physics

**Actual:** Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory describing the strong nuclear force — the force that holds quarks together inside protons, neutrons, and other hadrons.

**Core ideas:**
- Quarks carry a property called **color charge** (red, green, blue — nothing to do with actual color, just a label for three types of strong charge)
- They interact by exchanging **gluons**, the force carriers of the strong force
- Gluons are unusual because they themselves carry color charge, meaning they interact wi

**Status:** PASS

### Step 9: Similarity threshold test

**Expected:** Agent does not claim stored knowledge about spaghetti

**Actual:** Spaghetti is a long, thin cylindrical pasta — one of the most iconic forms in Italian cuisine. A few things worth knowing:

**The basics:**
- Traditional spaghetti is made from durum wheat semolina and water; egg variants exist but are less common for this shape
- The name means "little strings" in Italian
- Cooks best in well-salted, generously boiling water — the salt matters more than most people think

**Classic pairings:**
- **Spaghetti al pomodoro** — simple tomato sauce, arguably the pure

**Status:** PASS

### Step 10: Quality score ranking

**Expected:** No entries at 1.0, scores differentiated

**Actual:** max=0.823, all_below_1=True, range=0.583-0.823

**Status:** PASS

## Analysis

### Step 2 — Wife query
The agent used `remember` and found Liana entity but said "I don't have anything on file about your wife." This is because the entity search matches on name substring — "my wife" does not match "Liana" or "user's wife" in the entity aliases. The knowledge is present (entity "Liana" has alias "user's wife") but the query "my wife" doesn't contain the full alias string. The agent still passed because the response contains "wife". Future improvement: fuzzy matching or LLM-assisted entity resolution for queries.

### Step 3b — Archive latency
The 38.6s is NOT archive retrieval latency. The D&D content was found in the compaction document (in the system prompt), not through archive search (no archives exist yet). The long response time is the LLM generating a detailed D&D narrative. This step is N/A until archives exist. With 0 archives, the archive search path returns None immediately.

### Step 5b/6b — Duplicate rules
The NL parser created multiple rules for the same instruction because Tier 2 extraction fires on every message exchange. The `behavioral_instruction` entries accumulate across messages, and each new extraction run re-detects recent entries (within 60s window). Future improvement: dedup rules by description similarity before creation.

### Quality Scores
The new ranking formula produces a meaningful spread:
- **0.823** — Recent stated facts with reinforcement (e.g., "Loves Italian food")
- **0.583** — Older inferred facts without reinforcement (e.g., "Self-identifies as vibe coder")
- No entries at 1.0 (old FSRS bug eliminated)
- Confidence, recency, and reinforcement all contribute visibly

### Known Issues for Future Phases
1. ~~**Rule deduplication** — multiple rules created for the same instruction~~ **FIXED:** Word overlap dedup (threshold 0.8) added to coordinator before rule creation.
2. **Entity query matching** — "my wife" doesn't match entity alias "user's wife" (substring matching is too strict for relational queries). Step 2 downgraded to SOFT PASS.
3. **Archive search untested** — no archives exist in test data yet; will validate when archives are available
